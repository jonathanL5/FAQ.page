					<strong>what is my favorite color?</strong>
					<br>
					blue! it's the most popular favorite color to have which i guess makes me a little basic.
					i've read that it's a really popular pick because it's the rarest color in nature (excluding things like water, obviously)
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>
					<strong>what are my hobbies?</strong>
					<br>
					sports and video games.
					
					i've played soccer for seven years but recently switched to doing cross country. while i still think that soccer is much more enjoyable, i found it 
					stressful to play in a team. as a defender, i was always worried about messing up and being blamed for a loss. i can't even imagine how much stress goalies go through. 
					cross country is less stressful and generally fun.

					for video games, i exlcusively play multiplayer play games with competitive modes. i should probably stop playing these games but they have me in a chokehold.
					so yeah: league of legends, rocket league, fortnite, valorant are my main games. probably only considered good at rocket league though (league of legends needs to fix their matchmaking fr)

					i did enjoy omori though..

					<strong>do you listen to music?</strong>
					<br>
					YES. i started in middle school when i listened to the radio while doing my homework. over time i found various online communities that gave me music recommendations.
					then i started the classic pipeline: youtube playlists --> wait spotify is better --> i want to make good playlists to share --> youtube reviewers (really like toddintheshadows) --> 
					i want to make my own reviews --> rateyourmusic.com layout sucks. 

					anyways here is my album of the year account lmao
					spotify if ur interested

					oh wait i also played the piano for two years. playing an instrument doesn't make you like music though. the true way is to be forced to listen to the same five hot100 
					pop songs everytime you turn on the radio.

				</li>
				<br>

				<li>
					<strong>what other forms of media do you consume? (definitely a frequently asked question) </strong>
					<br>
					i used to watch a lot of movies but nowdays if a new movie comes out i'll just wait a couple of months for the cinemasins video on it. it's pretty much the same thing.
					if people tell me to watch a show i will read the plot of it on wikipedia, see if netflix has it, then watch like three episodes before stopping.
					
					i watch youtube all the time though. i enjoy comedy channels like casually explained, apandah, and technoblade (rip) as well as philosophy channels like
					exurb1a and sisyphus 55. 
					
					speaking of youtube, i have my own channel! actuallu, i've had many but i've since deleted them. my current one has 20 subscribers and it's mostly just
					video game clips. i still have a lot of my older videos saved and i might upload them in the future. i actually put effort into recording and editing those.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>how would you describe yourself as a person?</strong>
					<br>
					i am pretty introverted although i hope to change that in the future. my motivation to work is volatile but i generally get things done. a big belief of mine is that one is a product of their environment.
					staying true to this i would describe myself as smart and overly emotional. 
				</li>
				<br>


				<li>
					<strong>what are your future plans?</strong>
					<br>
					i'll be honest here. i'm going to univeristy in a few years and have been very stressed out due
					to wanting to get into the best one possible. why? my parents are both first-generation students. my parents are not originally from the US
					and getting their bachelor's degree was the sole reason why they were able to move out of the third-world country they used to live in. my mom specifically, lived in poverty
					and had an abusive dad (alcohol...) who believed that women weren't supposed to get an education. in other words, he wouldn't pay for her tuition. 
					yearning for a better quality of life, she studied hard in school
					on top working a job at a grocery store. in the end, she got accepted into a prestigious university which gave her free tuition (if you're interested: UNAM). my dad had a more privilaged background
					but also got accepted to the same school. my parents got married after graduating. after four years of working as a chemical engineer, my dad got a job offer in the US. 
					
					i kind of got off topic here.
					in short my plans are just going to a good univeristy and getting a job that pays enough so that i can start a family and be able to enjoy my hobbies.
